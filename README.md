# web3boilerplate

**A boilerplate for building decentralized applications (dApps) using Web3 technologies.**

This project serves as a foundation for developing dApps, integrating modern frontend technologies with Web3 features. It includes essential tools and configurations to accelerate the development process.

## Structure

### src/

The `src` directory contains the core application logic and components:

- **components/**: Reusable React components that make up the user interface.
- **pages/**: Specific pages of the application, each corresponding to different routes.
- **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers for interacting with Web3, smart contracts, and more.
- **hooks/**: Custom React hooks for managing state and effects related to Web3.

### public/

The `public` directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, and the `index.html` file which serves as the entry point for the application.

### contracts/

This directory stores the smart contracts, written in Solidity, which the dApp interacts with.

### package.json

This file manages dependencies, scripts, and project metadata, ensuring a smooth development experience with Node.js and npm.

### README.md

Provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and documentation.
